## Rules for RPA Development


With constant advancements and marketing in the RPA industry, RPA development has never been easier. With few drags and drops and clicks, you can technically create and deploy an automation. However, goes with the ease and speed of developments is the proliferation of half-baked automation designs and brittle bots that effectively undermine the promise of automation.

To counter this phenomenon, those at the managerial and gate-keeping positions devise checklists. In essence, they are rules. Over time, whenever rules don't work, there are more rules and what you end up with is a big spreadsheet that makes developers grunt (and yawn). After all, those who sign up to be developers tend to love the thrill of problem-solving, autonomy and be obsessed with efficiency. Checklists? How about writing a bot to tick them all? lol

While checklists are certainly useful in the right places, what I aspire to offer in this essay are not rules in the checklist sense. Instead, they are a collection of practices, most of which are thought of as principles in software development classics. To borrow a quote from my favorite classics, Programming Pearls, and make it my own version: "Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that have irritated real oysters", these practices "have grown from real problems that have irritated" me. 

1. Working backwards

2. Small Workflows

3. Write code documents early and write often

4. Tabulate rules, errors, changing details

5. Precise variable assignments

6. Check for inputs and output conditions

7. Write test for modules before coding for the module itself

8. Write the story for each major components of the solution and how they interact with the queue

9. Assume failures

When it comes to achieve the best version of ourselves, we are our own biggest enemy. To battle our own constant influx of biases, emotions and mental shortcuts, a checklist is necessary. Charlie Munger once said, "No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use his checklist". Checklists are there to catch where we did wrong. Make these practices a checklist if you like, but I beg to make this important distinction. This is not a list of checkboxes to tick at the end of your project, this should be where you look at before you even write a line of code. This should be part of daily reflection on the work done. If this checklist save your neck the next time a tough project throws at you, you are welcome. If you follow the rules and still fall short of the expectations, perhaps it is not your fault.
